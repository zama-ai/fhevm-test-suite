## Handling Sensitive Data

This document outlines security best practices for the HTTPZ project, particularly regarding the handling of sensitive configuration data.

### Environment Files

Our repository contains example environment files `env/staging` that include sensitive values like private keys, mnemonics, and API keys. **These values are for testing purposes only** and should never be used in production environments.

For production deployments:
- **Do not** use the same keys, passwords, or mnemonics that appear in the example files
- **Do not** commit actual production secrets to any repository
- **Do** use a proper secrets management solution:
  - Environment variables managed by your deployment platform
  - HashiCorp Vault or similar secrets management service
  - AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, or Azure Key Vault
  - Kubernetes Secrets (with proper encryption)

Example of replacing sensitive data in production:
```bash
# Replace test mnemonic with environment variable reference
# TEST: MNEMONIC=coyote sketch defense hover finger envelope celery urge panther venue verb cheese
MNEMONIC=${PRODUCTION_MNEMONIC}

# Replace test private key with key stored in a secure vault
# TEST: TX_SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x8f82b3f482c19a95ac29c82cf048c076ed0de2530c64a73f2d2d7d1e64b5cc6e
TX_SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY=${SECURE_PRIVATE_KEY}
```
### Development Environment

When developing locally:

- Use `.env.local` files (added to `.gitignore`) for your personal secrets
- Rotate keys regularly, especially if used for shared development environments
- Consider using environment-specific configuration files (dev, staging, prod)
- Use fake/test data for local development whenever possible


### Common Sensitive Data
The following values should NEVER be committed to repositories:

- Private keys
- Mnemonics
- API keys
- Database credentials
- JWT secrets

## Reporting Security Issues
Please report security vulnerabilities to security@zama.ia rather than creating public issues.

Include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested mitigation (if any)
